Write the following program in Java.

A DFA generator will accept a 5 tuple that consists of a set of states, an alphabet set,
 a transition function, an initial state and a set of final states.
  It will return a DFA which in turn can determine whether a string is in that language or not.

Please ensure that the 5 tuple can be specified as a JSON object in a file.
 The transition function can be written as a transition table:

ex:

q1,1,q1
q1,0,q2
...
...



Here is a JSON of examples that you can use. The JSON file has a list of DFAs.
 Each DFA is of the following format.

:name "odd number of zeroes",
:type "dfa",
:tuple {:states #{:q1 :q2},
:alphabets #{"1" "0"},
:delta {:q1 {0 :q2, 1 :q1}, :q2 {0 :q1, 1 :q2}},
:start-state :q1,
:final-states #{:q2}},
:pass-cases ["0" "000" "00000" "10" "101010" "010101"],
:fail-cases ["00" "0000" "1001" "1010" "001100"]
